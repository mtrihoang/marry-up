# Student project: Replication of Ran, Adeline & Luis (2011)

For my final project, I replicate results from [Ran, A., Adeline, D., & Luis, V. (2011)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.3.3.124&ArticleSearch%5Bwithin%5D%5Barticletitle%5D=1&ArticleSearch%5Bwithin%5D%5Barticleabstract%5D=1&ArticleSearch%5Bwithin%5D%5Bauthorlast%5D=1&ArticleSearch%5Bq%5D=matching&JelClass%5Bvalue%5D=0&journal=4&from=j). Marrying Up: The Role of Sex Ratio in Assortative Matching. _American Economic Journal: Applied Economics_, 3(3), 124-57.

## Project overview

Abramitzky et al. (2011) investigate the impact of male scarcity on marital assortative matching and marriage market outcomes. Using the difference-in-differences and IV approaches, they find that in regions with higher mortality rates, women were more likely to remain single postwar, out-of-wedlock births increased, divorce rates and the age gap decreased. Overall, the results in this notebook strongly support the empirical findings reported by Abramitzky et al. (2011). Based on the transparent research methods and Stata code, I can replicate and produce outputs similar to those in the original paper, including OLS, IV regressions, and bootstrap simulation.
